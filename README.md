## Introduction

Inspired by the song "You Can't Put Your Arms Around a Memory", Thundrs is a respository to
digitialize the memories you no longer put your hands around either.

Concept:  Not just a photo pail but a place to reconnect with nostalgia and shared memories
from someone you might have kissed at a concert 20 years ago and never forgot.
