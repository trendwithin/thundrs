# Introduction

Inspired by the song "You Can't Put Your Arms Around a Memory"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0_2aWbOmJc&spfreload=10,
Thundrs is a respository to digitialize the memories you no longer
put your hands around either.

Concept:  Not just a photo pail but a place to reconnect with nostalgia and
shared memories from someone you might have ecountered at a concert 20 years
ago and never forgot.
